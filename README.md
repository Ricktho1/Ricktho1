# ðŸ’« About Me: 
Hello!
I am Ricktho Sarkar,a passionate coder from West Bengal. I am currently a 2nd Year Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. Iâ€™m currently working on Deep Learning related projects. My particular interest lies in Computer Vision and Robotics though I am open to explore other domains as well in the field of deep learning. I am well versed with the Pytorch and Tensorflow library though I generally prefer Pytorch. I have also quite some expertise in ROS and Linux from implementing packages for autonomous driving to trying to simulate bots and cars in Gazebo,Pybullet and Carla. I have also been learning and practicing DSA through competitive programming. Other than that I have also explored some parts of Software Development like app development where I had made few small projects and also some amount of Game Development in pygame and Godot. Besides I am in many important positions in my college which is a testimony to my qualities of being a responsible person.
